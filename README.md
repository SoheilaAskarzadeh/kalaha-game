# Kalaha Game

## Overview 
  This Java-based application implements the popular board game "Kalaha." Kalaha, also known as Mancala, is a two-player strategy game that involves moving stones around a board to capture your opponent's stones.

## Features
 - *2 Players*
 - *12 pits - 6 on each player's side*
 - *72 stones - 6 stones in each pit at the start of the game*
   
## Game Rules
   - *Game Play*

     The player who begins with the first move picks up all the stones in any of his
     six pits and sows the stones onto the right, one in each of the following
     pits, including his big pit. No stones are put in the opponents' big pit. If the
     player's last stone lands in his big pit, he gets another turn. This can be
     repeated several times before it's the other player's turn.

  - *Capturing Stones*
    
    During the game, the pits are emptied on both sides. Always when the last stone
    lands in their empty pit, the player captures his stone and all stones in the
    opposite pit and puts them in his pit.
  
  - *The Game Ends*
    
    The game is over when one of the sides runs out of stones. The player who
    still has stones in his pits keeps them and puts them in his big pit. The winner of
    the game is the player who has the most stones in his big pit.
